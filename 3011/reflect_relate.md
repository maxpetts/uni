## **Week 1** - SSH Remote Access
### Concepts learnt: 
 - Authentication
 - SSH (Secure SHell)
 - Cryptography (RSA Cryptosystem)

In order to ensure the appropriate actors(users) are able to access the correct areas of a system, but are denied access to other. To achieve this the security system must be able to differentiate between users; when discussing authentication the user being identified is called the Principal.



This weeks lab detailed the steps that must be taken in order to remotely connect to another machine via SSH, provided it's connected to the internet, or the same local network. 

Once an SSH connection had been established I used the command  *ssh-keygen* to generate an RSA key. This is used to circumvent the transmission of passwords, which can be cracked using brute force attacks, phishing scams or network analysers(if transmitting in plain text). However, a password is used to authenticate the user, but this doesn't leave the computer.

I use git to track changes to my projects, which requires a public key before any changes can be pushed to the repository; if this repo contained sensitive information then the key should use ECDSA, as RSA is vulnerable to [timing attacks[1]](http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/ssl-timing.pdf).

## **Week 2** - GPG - *GNU Privacy Guard*
### Concepts learnt:
 - The CIA Triad 

CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
 Without can't gaurantee secure transfer of information at all.
Encryption ensures that transmitted data remains private 
## **Week 3** - E-Mail Spoofing
### Concepts learnt:
 - Security from the start
Building on top of previous security layers means nothing if not secure.

## **Week 4** - 'Real World' Cracking
### Concepts learnt:
- Validation
"Trust is the root of all compromise"
